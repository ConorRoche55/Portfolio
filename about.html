        <p>After graduating with a Bachelor of Music in 2017, I taught instrumental music for a few years. I very quickly realised that this was not the path for me so I started investigating other career options. Upon looking into the web development world I began coding along to basic youtube tutorials and fell in love with it. I am currently studying the accelerated web development course at Coder Academy and while the the workload is immense, I am greatly enjoying the learning process.</p>

        <h4>Hobbies</h4>
        <p>My first love is music. I have been playing guitar for 15 years, playing gigs here and there on the weekends. While guitar is my primary instrument, I also play piano, drums and bass guitar.
            Other activities I enjoy include going to the gym, reading and exploring the great outdoors.
